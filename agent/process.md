# Process

This project follows a strict test-driven development (TDD) workflow. For each topic in steps.md:

1. Write unit tests first (red phase)
2. Run tests and confirm they fail
3. Implement the code (green phase)
4. Run tests and confirm they pass
5. Update steps.md with a check mark for the completed topic
6. Request user approval before proceeding to the next topic
7. Document every completed step in steps.md and process.md

## Last completed step

- User CRUD unit tests written and passing (mocked, no DB; integration tests deferred until service layer exists)
